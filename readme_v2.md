# VFIX

## Project Overview
The widespread use of smart contracts across various industries has made them an attractive target for cyberattacks, leading to substantial financial losses. As a result, continuously patching newly discovered vulnerabilities in smart contracts has become an essential maintenance task. However, addressing these vulnerabilities requires specific security expertise, which many developers lack, making the task labor-intensive without effective tool support.

To meet this critical need, we present **VFIX**, a tool that automatically generates security patches for vulnerable smart contracts. VFIX combines template-based repairs with static program analysis techniques tailored to smart contracts. Our evaluations on 144 real-world smart contracts containing different types of vulnerabilities demonstrate that VFIX can successfully patch 94% of the vulnerabilities while preserving the expected functionality of the contracts.

## Installation Guide

### 1. Install Required Static Analysis Tools
