## Data Description

File effectiveness.csv shows the original data in the Table IV. We manually check the
patch generated by ContractFix and summarize the number of 
successful/failed patches.

File transaction-replay.csv contains the original data shown in 
the Table V. For each vulnerability category, we collect transaction data
for the top 5 contracts and compare the execution result of the
original contract and the patched contract.
